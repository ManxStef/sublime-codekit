# CodeKit .kit File Syntax Highlighting Plugin for Sublime Text

This is a Sublime Text plugin that adds standard HTML syntax highlighting for CodeKit .kit files. It also adds basic keyboard completions for the keywords `import`, `include` and `myvar`.

## Installation
The easiest way to install this plugin is using the excellent [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just installed Package Control, you'll need to restart Sublime Text first. Once this is done -
 * Bring up the Command Palette (`Command + Shift + p` on OS X, `Control + Shift + p` on Linux/Windows)
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select SublimeCodeKit when it appears in the list

 Package Control will automatically keep SublimeCodeKit up to date with the latest version.

To install the plugin manually, [download](https://github.com/ManxStef/sublime-codekit/archive/master.zip) and place it in your Packages directory (`Preferences -> Browse Packages`, place it in the `User` folder).
